# 2048-game
2048 game for JVM with options to change winning score and board dimensions. 

Several options are provided. The player can reset the game, change winning score, board dimensions, and undo any number of moves up to the start of the game by clicking the appropriate labeled buttons at the top. 

While the game passes, some statistics are kept. These statistics include total games played, total moves over all games, and total moves for the current game.

The GUI uses a JFrame and JPanel grid.

Board set to 16x16 with 2048 winning score (a "You Win" popup appeared that's not pictured):
